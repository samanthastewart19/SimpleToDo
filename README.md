## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

-Woking with different versions of Android Studio posed a challenge for me especially when using functions that would be implemented differently from the prework video walkthrough guide. The file directories kept crashing and could not be located as well as the items would not show after being added. After researching the different formatting and syntax between the versions, I was abke to correctlt implement the functions and instances to successful show the items after being added. Due to time contraint, the app currently does not support updating an item after being added, this is a functionality that will be updated.
